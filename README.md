## Motivation
The package is supposed to give the light curves of variable stars from Gaia Data Releases (1 and 2) with a star name that can be resolved by SIMBAD. It eliminates the need of checking different folders/without going through the task of using separate CSV files and cross-matching tables or Datalink from Gaia, and can work on several stars at once (passed through a list)

## Installation
The package is installable on Python 3.x. To install the package, simply write

`pip install GaiaCurves`

 A list of dependencies is available in requirements.txt
